This program calculates the electric and spin excitations for bulk
and thin films. It can describe Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) experiments
and intrinsic Spin and Orbital Momentum Hall Effects (including Anomalous
and Planar Hall effects), for example.
A multi-orbital tight-binding model (as parametrized by Slater and Koster [1])
is used, with the el-el interaction
described by a Hubbard-like hamiltonian [2].  The spin-orbit interaction
is present, and a static magnetic field can be applied in any direction.
Excitations are obtained in Kubo's linear response approach [3].

An applied AC electric field (described by a time-dependent potential
vector) that couples to the current density is applied, and the following
responses are calculated (for each site in the unit cell):
 - local spin accumulations;
 - local orbital momentum accumulations in each site;
 - spin-orbit, exchange and external torques;
 - effective magnetic fields;
 - spin and charge currents*;
 - orbital momentum currents*;
 - DC components of pumped spin currents*.<br>
(* currents need reimplementation for the new generalized cell)

The full 4x4 magnetic susceptibility matrix, including transverse and
longitudinal blocks, is also evaluated.

The LDOS in each site, band structure, Fermi surface, and full exchange
coupling tensor (including DMI and anisotropic terms are also implemented.

The program is currently written for 9 orbitals per site
(1 <i>s</i>,3 <i>p</i> and 5 <i>d</i>), for a given set of
nearest neighbours hopping parameters. The parameters obtained from DFT calculations
can be found, for example, in the book of D. A. Papaconstantopoulus [4].
The generalized response functions are obtained as a function of the frequency
within the Random-Phase Approximation, which are calculated from the mean-field counterpart.
These ones are evaluated in terms of the monoeletronic Green functions.
The integration in k-space (2D or 3D) is calculated using a uniformly spaced k-mesh.
The integration over energy is done in the complex plane - part in the imaginary axis
and part in the real axis (for &#969;&#8800;0).
The code is parallelized using openMP and MPI.

Plotting scripts (in Python) are provided in the 'scripts' folder.

## Compiling the code

### Download:

First clone the repository on your local computer or supercomputer of choice.
```batch
git clone https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/titan/TITAN.git
cd TITAN/build
```

### Compile:

To use `TITAN` in the super computers, the compiler and MPI modules, as well as `CMake` must be loaded.

For example, to use the intel compiler:
`module load Intel IntelMPI CMake`
or to use GFortran:
`module load GCC ParaStationMPI CMake`

`TITAN` uses CMake to create the Makefile for compilation. The following options are available:
```batch
cmake ../ -DPLATFORM=system [-DCOMPILER=compiler -DDEBUG=ON]
make -j12
```
The system is defined for the intel compiler, and can be `jureca`, `booster` (for JURECA Booster), `juwels`, `jusuf`, `iff`.
TITAN was tested for the compilers: `ifort` (default), `gfortran` (gnu) and `pgi`.

The generated binary can be found in `TITAN/bin/`, and its filename contains the system, compiler (if not ifort) and `debug` if the respective flag was used.

## Running the code

After compiling you can start running the code.
An example calculation can be found in `TITAN/example`

### SLURM

One example of a submission script used for the SLURM workload manager:
```batch
#!/bin/bash -x
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH -J JobName
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24
#SBATCH -e error-%j
#SBATCH -o output-%j
#SBATCH --mail-user=your@mail
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --partition=batch
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00

module load Intel IntelMPI NAG/Mark26

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

export OMP_STACKSIZE=150m
export KMP_AFFINITY=scatter

srun ~/TITAN/bin/titan_jureca.exe --exports=NAG_KUSARI_FILE --exports=OMP_NUM_THREADS --exports=MKL_NUM_THREADS --exports=KMP_AFFINITY
```

### Linux

To directly run the code with 2 MPI processes and 4 openMP threads:
``` batch
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
mpirun -np 2 ~/TITAN/bin/titan.exe --exports=OMP_NUM_THREADS
```
## Automatic tests

`TITAN` contains various examples that are used as automatic tests using gitlab-ci. They are located in TITAN/examples.
