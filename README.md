This program calculates the electric and spin excitations for bulk
and thin films. It can describe Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) experiments
and intrinsic Spin and Orbital Momentum Hall Effects (including Anomalous 
and Planar Hall effects), for example.
A multi-orbital tight-binding model is used, with the el-el interaction 
described by a Hubbard-like hamiltonian [2].  The spin-orbit interaction
is present, and a static magnetic field can be applied in any direction.
Excitations are obtained in Kubo's linear response approach [1].

An applied AC electric field (described by a time-dependent potential
vector) that couples to the current density is applied, and the following
responses are calculated (for each site in the unit cell):
 - local spin accumulations;
 - local orbital momentum accumulations in each site;
 - spin-orbit, exchange and external torques;
 - effective magnetic fields;
 - spin and charge currents*;
 - orbital momentum currents*;
 - DC components of pumped spin currents*.<br>
(* currents need reimplementation for the new generalized cell)

The full 4x4 magnetic susceptibility matrix, including transverse and 
longitudinal blocks, is also evaluated.

The LDOS in each site, band structure, Fermi surface, and full exchange 
coupling tensor (including DMI and anisotropic terms are also implemented.

The program is currently written for 9 orbitals per site 
(1 <i>s</i>,3 <i>p</i> and 5 <i>d</i>), for a given set of 
nearest neighbours hopping parameters (as described by Slater and Koster [3]).
The generalized response functions are obtained as a function of the frequency
within the Random-Phase Approximation, which are calculated from the mean-field counterpart.
These ones are evaluated in terms of the monoeletronic Green functions. 
The integration in k-space (2D or 3D) is calculated using a uniformly spaced k-mesh.
The integration over energy is done in the complex plane - part in the imaginary axis
and part in the real axis (for &#969;&#8800;0).
The code is parallelized using openMP and MPI.

Plotting scripts (in Python) are provided in the 'scripts' folder.
