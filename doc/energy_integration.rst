Energy Integration
******************

Here we explain how the energy integration (required for most of the calculations) is done.

When eigenstates are used, it becomes a simple sum over the eigenstates.

When Green functions are used (e.g., for the eigenstates or the response calculations), the energy integral from :math:`-\infty` to :math:`E_\text{F}` (:math:`T=0K`) along the real axis are substituted by an integral in the complex plane.
