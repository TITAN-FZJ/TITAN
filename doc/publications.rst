    | **Title**:    Orbital magnetoelectric effect in zigzag nanoribbons of p-band systems
    | **Authors**:  Tarik P. Cysne, Filipe S. M. Guimarães, Luis M. Canonico, Tatiana G. Rappoport, R. B. Muniz
    | **Abstract**: Profiles of the spin and orbital angular momentum accumulations induced by a longitudinally applied electric field are explored in nanoribbons of p-band systems with a honeycomb lattice. We show that nanoribbons with zigzag borders can exhibit orbital magnetoelectric effects. More specifically, we have found that purely orbital magnetization oriented perpendicularly to the ribbon may be induced in these systems by means of the external electric field, when sublattice symmetry is broken. The effect is rather general and may occur in other multi-orbital materials.

    | **Title**:    Polarisation-dependent single-pulse ultrafast optical switching of an elementary ferromagnet
    | **Authors**:  Hanan Hamamera, Filipe Souza Mendes Guimarães, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Samir Lounis
    | **Abstract**: The ultimate control of magnetic states of matter at femtosecond (or even faster) timescales defines one of the most pursued paradigm shifts for future information technology. In this context, ultrafast laser pulses developed into extremely valuable stimuli for the all-optical magnetisation reversal in ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic alloys and multilayers, while this remains elusive in elementary ferromagnets. Here we demonstrate that a single laser pulse with sub-picosecond duration can lead to the reversal of the magnetisation of bulk nickel, in tandem with the expected demagnetisation. As revealed by realistic time-dependent electronic structure simulations, the central mechanism is ultrafast light-induced torques acting on the magnetisation, which are only effective if the laser pulse is circularly polarised on a plane that contains the initial orientation of the magnetisation. We map the laser pulse parameter space enabling the magnetisation switching and unveil rich intra-atomic orbital-dependent magnetisation dynamics featuring transient inter-orbital non-collinear states. Our findings open further perspectives for the efficient implementation of optically-based spintronic devices.

    | **Title**:    Spin-orbit torques and their associated effective fields from gigahertz to terahertz
    | **Authors**:  Filipe S. M. Guimarães, Juba Bouaziz, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Samir Lounis
    | **Abstract**: Terahertz spintronics offers the prospect of devices which are both faster and more energy-efficient. A promising route to achieve this goal is to exploit current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, the high-frequency properties of these quantities remain unexplored both experimentally and theoretically, within a realistic material-specific approach. Here we investigate the dynamical transverse components of the torques and uncover contributions longitudinal to the magnetic moment capable of changing its magnitude. We show that, while the torques can be drastically altered in the dynamical regime, the effective magnetic fields that accompany them present a frequency-independent behaviour, ranging from the static limit up to the terahertz domain - including the ferromagnetic resonance of the system. The outcomes of this work point to new ways to control magnetic units in next-generation spintronic devices.

    | **Title**:    Comparative study of methodologies to compute the intrinsic Gilbert damping: interrelations, validity and physical consequences
    | **Authors**:  Filipe S. M. Guimarães, J. R. Suckert, Jonathan Chico, Juba Bouaziz, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Samir Lounis
    | **Abstract**: Relaxation effects are of primary importance in the description of magnetic excitations, leading to a myriad of methods addressing the phenomenological damping parameters. In this work, we consider several well-established forms of calculating the intrinsic Gilbert damping within a unified theoretical framework, mapping out their connections and the approximations required to derive each formula. This scheme enables a direct comparison of the different methods on the same footing and a consistent evaluation of their range of validity. Most methods lead to very similar results for the bulk ferromagnets Fe, Co and Ni, due to the low spin-orbit interaction strength and the absence of the spin pumping mechanism. The effects of inhomogeneities, temperature and other sources of finite electronic lifetime are often accounted for by an empirical broadening of the electronic energy levels. We show that the contribution to the damping introduced by this broadening is additive, and so can be extracted by comparing the results of the calculations performed with and without spin-orbit interaction. Starting from simulated ferromagnetic resonance spectra based on the underlying electronic structure, we unambiguously demonstrate that the damping parameter obtained within the constant broadening approximation diverges for three-dimensional bulk magnets in the clean limit, while it remains finite for monolayers. Our work puts into perspective the several methods available to describe and compute the Gilbert damping, building a solid foundation for future investigations of magnetic relaxation effects in any kind of material.

    | **Title**:    Dynamical amplification of magnetoresistances and Hall currents up to the THz regime
    | **Authors**:  Filipe S. M. Guimarães, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Juba Bouaziz, Antonio T. Costa, Roberto B. Muniz, Samir Lounis
    | **Abstract**: Spin-orbit-related effects offer a highly promising route for reading and writing information in magnetic units of future devices. These phenomena rely not only on the static magnetization orientation but also on its dynamics to achieve fast switchings that can reach the THz range. In this work, we consider Co/Pt and Fe/W bilayers to show that accounting for the phase difference between different processes is crucial to the correct description of the dynamical currents. By tuning each system towards its ferromagnetic resonance, we reveal that dynamical spin Hall angles can non-trivially change sign and be boosted by over 500%, reaching giant values. We demonstrate that charge and spin pumping mechanisms can greatly magnify or dwindle the currents flowing through the system, influencing all kinds of magnetoresistive and Hall effects, thus impacting also dc and second harmonic experimental measurements.

    | **Title**:    Dynamical current-induced ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic resonances
    | **Authors**:  F. S. M. Guimarães, S. Lounis, A. T. Costa, R. B. Muniz
    | **Abstract**: We demonstrate that ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic excitations can be triggered by the dynamical spin accumulations induced by the bulk and surface contributions of the spin Hall effect. Due to the spin-orbit interaction, a time-dependent spin density is generated by an oscillatory electric field applied parallel to the atomic planes of Fe/W(110) multilayers. For symmetric trilayers of Fe/W/Fe in which the Fe layers are ferromagnetically coupled, we demonstrate that only the collective out-of-phase precession mode is excited, while the uniform (in-phase) mode remains silent. When they are antiferromagnetically coupled, the oscillatory electric field sets the Fe magnetizations into elliptical precession motions with opposite angular velocities. The manipulation of different collective spin-wave dynamical modes through the engineering of the multilayers and their thicknesses may be used to develop ultrafast spintronics devices. Our work provides a general framework that probes the realistic responses of materials in the time or frequency domain.
