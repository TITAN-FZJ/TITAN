!***DESCRIPTION
!
!   This subroutine is a companion routine to SNLS1,SNLS1E,SNSQ,and
!   SNSQE which may be used to check the calculation of the Jacobian.
!
!     SUBROUTINE CHKDER
!
!     This subroutine checks the gradients of M nonlinear functions
!     in N variables, evaluated at a point X, for consistency with
!     the functions themselves. The user must call CKDER twice,
!     first with MODE = 1 and then with MODE = 2.
!
!     MODE = 1. On input, X must contain the point of evaluation.
!               On output, XP is set to a neighboring point.
!
!     MODE = 2. On input, FVEC must contain the functions and the
!                         rows of FJAC must contain the gradients
!                         of the respective functions each evaluated
!                         at X, and FVECP must contain the functions
!                         evaluated at XP.
!               On output, ERR contains measures of correctness of
!                          the respective gradients.
!
!     The subroutine does not perform reliably if cancellation or
!     rounding errors cause a severe loss of significance in the
!     evaluation of a function. Therefore, none of the components
!     of X should be unusually small (in particular, zero) or any
!     other value which may cause loss of significance.
!
!     The SUBROUTINE statement is
!
!       SUBROUTINE CHKDER(M,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,XP,FVECP,MODE,ERR)
!
!     where
!
!       M is a positive INTEGER      :: input variable set to the number
!         of functions.
!
!       N is a positive INTEGER      :: input variable set to the number
!         of variables.
!
!       X is an input array of length N.
!
!       FVEC is an array of length M. On input when MODE = 2,
!         FVEC must contain the functions evaluated at X.
!
!       FJAC is an M by N array. On input when MODE = 2,
!         the rows of FJAC must contain the gradients of
!         the respective functions evaluated at X.
!
!       LDFJAC is a positive INTEGER      :: input parameter not less than M
!         which specifies the leading dimension of the array FJAC.
!
!       XP is an array of length N. On output when MODE = 1,
!         XP is set to a neighboring point of X.
!
!       FVECP is an array of length M. On input when MODE = 2,
!         FVECP must contain the functions evaluated at XP.
!
!       MODE is an INTEGER      :: input variable set to 1 on the first call
!         and 2 on the second. Other values of MODE are equivalent
!         to MODE = 1.
!
!       ERR is an array of length M. On output when MODE = 2,
!         ERR contains measures of correctness of the respective
!         gradients. If there is no severe loss of significance,
!         then if ERR(I) is 1.0 the I-th gradient is correct,
!         while if ERR(I) is 0.0 the I-th gradient is incorrect.
!         For values of ERR between 0.0 and 1.0, the categorization
!         is less certain. In general, a value of ERR(I) greater
!         than 0.5 indicates that the I-th gradient is probably
!         correct, while a value of ERR(I) less than 0.5 indicates
!         that the I-th gradient is probably incorrect.

! !***DESCRIPTION
! !
! !     Abstract
! !        Allows user control over handling of individual errors.
! !        Just after each message is recorded, but before it is
! !        processed any further (i.e., before it is printed or
! !        a decision to abort is made), a call is made to XERCNT.
! !        If the user has provided his own version of XERCNT, he
! !        can then override the value of KONTROL used in processing
! !        this message by redefining its value.
! !        KONTRL may be set to any value from -2 to 2.
! !        The meanings for KONTRL are the same as in XSETF, except
! !        that the value of KONTRL changes only for this message.
! !        If KONTRL is set to a value outside the range from -2 to 2,
! !        it will be moved back into that range.
! !
! !     Description of Parameters
! !
! !      --Input--
! !        LIBRAR - the library that the routine is in.
! !        SUBROU - the subroutine that XERMSG is being called from

      SUBROUTINE XERMSG (LIBRAR, SUBROU, MESSG, NERR, LEVEL)
!***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERMSG
!***PURPOSE  Process error messages for SLATEC and other libraries.
!***LIBRARY   SLATEC (XERROR)
!***CATEGORY  R3C
!***TYPE      ALL (XERMSG-A)
!***KEYWORDS  ERROR MESSAGE, XERROR
!***AUTHOR  Fong, Kirby, (NMFECC at LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!   XERMSG processes a diagnostic message in a manner determined by the
!   value of LEVEL and the current value of the library error control
!   flag, KONTRL.  See subroutine XSETF for details.
!
!    LIBRAR   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
!             of the library.  This will be 'SLATEC' for the SLATEC
!             Common Math Library.  The error handling package is
!             general enough to be used by many libraries
!             simultaneously, so it is desirable for the routine that
!             detects and reports an error to identify the library name
!             as well as the routine name.
!
!    SUBROU   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
!             of the routine that detected the error.  Usually it is the
!             name of the routine that is calling XERMSG.  There are
!             some instances where a user callable library routine calls
!             lower level subsidiary routines where the error is
!             detected.  In such cases it may be more informative to
!             supply the name of the routine the user called rather than
!             the name of the subsidiary routine that detected the
!             error.
!
!    MESSG    A character constant (or character variable) with the text
!             of the error or warning message.  In the example below,
!             the message is a character constant that contains a
!             generic message.
!
!                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY',
!                  *'THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS THE ROW DIMENSION',
!                  *3, 1)
!
!             It is possible (and is sometimes desirable) to generate a
!             specific message--e.g., one that contains actual numeric
!             values.  Specific numeric values can be converted into
!             character strings using formatted WRITE statements into
!             character variables.  This is called standard Fortran
!             internal file I/O and is exemplified in the first three
!             lines of the following example.  You can also catenate
!             substrings of characters to construct the error message.
!             Here is an example showing the use of both writing to
!             an internal file and catenating character strings.
!
!                   CHARACTER*5 CHARN, CHARL
!                   WRITE (CHARN,10) N
!                   WRITE (CHARL,10) LDA
!                10 FORMAT(I5)
!                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY', 'THE ORDER'//CHARN//
!                  *   ' OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS ITS ROW DIMENSION OF'//
!                  *   CHARL, 3, 1)
!
!             There are two subtleties worth mentioning.  One is that
!             the // for character catenation is used to construct the
!             error message so that no single character constant is
!             continued to the next line.  This avoids confusion as to
!             whether there are trailing blanks at the end of the line.
!             The second is that by catenating the parts of the message
!             as an actual argument rather than encoding the entire
!             message into one large character variable, we avoid
!             having to know how long the message will be in order to
!             declare an adequate length for that large character
!             variable.  XERMSG calls XERPRN to print the message using
!             multiple lines if necessary.  If the message is very long,
!             XERPRN will break it into pieces of 72 characters (as
!             requested by XERMSG) for printing on multiple lines.
!             Also, XERMSG asks XERPRN to prefix each line with ' *  '
!             so that the total line length could be 76 characters.
!             Note also that XERPRN scans the error message backwards
!             to ignore trailing blanks.  Another feature is that
!             the substring '$$' is treated as a new line sentinel
!             by XERPRN.  If you want to construct a multiline
!             message without having to kount out multiples of 72
!             characters, just use '$$' as a separator.  '$$'
!             obviously must occur within 72 characters of the
!             start of each line to have its intended effect since
!             XERPRN is asked to wrap around at 72 characters in
!             addition to looking for '$$'.
!
!    NERR     An INTEGER      :: value that is chosen by the library routines
!             author.  It must be in the range -99 to 999 (three
!             printable digits).  Each distinct error should have its
!             own error number.  These error numbers should be described
!             in the machine readable documentation for the routine.
!             The error numbers need be unique only within each routine,
!             so it is reasonable for each routine to start enumerating
!             errors from 1 and proceeding to the next integer.
!
!    LEVEL    An INTEGER      :: value in the range 0 to 2 that indicates the
!             level (severity) of the error.  Their meanings are
!
!            -1  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
!                that there really is an error, but the users attention
!                may be needed.  An attempt is made to only print this
!                message once.
!
!             0  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
!                that there really is an error, but the users attention
!                may be needed.
!
!             1  A recoverable error.  This is used even if the error is
!                so serious that the routine cannot return any useful
!                answer.  If the user has told the error package to
!                return after recoverable errors, then XERMSG will
!                return to the Library routine which can then return to
!                the users routine.  The user may also permit the error
!                package to terminate the program upon encountering a
!                recoverable error.
!
!             2  A fatal error.  XERMSG will not return to its caller
!                after it receives a fatal error.  This level should
!                hardly ever be used; it is much better to allow the
!                user a chance to recover.  An example of one of the few
!                cases in which it is permissible to declare a level 2
!                error is a reverse communication Library routine that
!                is likely to be called repeatedly until it integrates
!                across some interval.  If there is a serious error in
!                the input such that another step cannot be taken and
!                the Library routine is called again without the input
!                error having been corrected by the caller, the Library
!                routine will probably be called forever with improper
!                input.  In this case, it is reasonable to declare the
!                error to be fatal.
!
!    Each of the arguments to XERMSG is input; none will be modified by
!    XERMSG.  A routine may make multiple calls to XERMSG with warning
!    level messages; however, after a call to XERMSG with a recoverable
!    error, the routine should return to the user.  Do not try to call
!    XERMSG with a second recoverable error after the first recoverable
!    error because the error package saves the error number.  The user
!    can retrieve this error number by calling another entry point in
!    the error handling package and then clear the error number when
!    recovering from the error.  Calling XERMSG in succession causes the
!    old error number to be overwritten by the latest error number.
!    This is considered harmless for error numbers associated with
!    warning messages but must not be done for error numbers of serious
!    errors.  After a call to XERMSG with a recoverable error, the user
!    must be given a chance to call NUMXER or XERCLR to retrieve or
!    clear the error number.

!***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
!   880101  DATE WRITTEN
!   880621  REVISED AS DIRECTED AT SLATEC CML MEETING OF FEBRUARY 1988.
!           THERE ARE TWO BASIC CHANGES.
!           1.  A NEW ROUTINE, XERPRN, IS USED INSTEAD OF XERPRT TO
!               PRINT MESSAGES.  THIS ROUTINE WILL BREAK LONG MESSAGES
!               INTO PIECES FOR PRINTING ON MULTIPLE LINES.  '$$' IS
!               ACCEPTED AS A NEW LINE SENTINEL.  A PREFIX CAN BE
!               ADDED TO EACH LINE TO BE PRINTED.  XERMSG USES EITHER
!               ' ***' OR ' *  ' AND LONG MESSAGES ARE BROKEN EVERY
!               72 CHARACTERS (AT MOST) SO THAT THE MAXIMUM LINE
!               LENGTH OUTPUT CAN NOW BE AS GREAT AS 76.
!           2.  THE TEXT OF ALL MESSAGES IS NOW IN UPPER CASE SINCE THE
!               FORTRAN STANDARD DOCUMENT DOES NOT ADMIT THE EXISTENCE
!               OF LOWER CASE.
!   880708  REVISED AFTER THE SLATEC CML MEETING OF JUNE 29 AND 30.
!           THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES ARE
!           1.  CLARIFY COMMENTS IN THE PROLOGUES
!           2.  RENAME XRPRNT TO XERPRN
!           3.  REWORK HANDLING OF '$$' IN XERPRN TO HANDLE BLANK LINES
!               SIMILAR TO THE WAY FORMAT STATEMENTS HANDLE THE /
!               CHARACTER FOR NEW RECORDS.
!   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
!           CLEAN UP THE CODING.
!   890721  REVISED TO USE NEW FEATURE IN XERPRN TO COUNT CHARACTERS IN
!           PREFIX.
!   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT COMMENTS.
!   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
!   900510  Changed test on NERR to be -9999999 < NERR < 99999999, but
!           NERR /= 0, and on LEVEL to be -2 < LEVEL < 3.  Added
!           LEVEL=-1 logic, changed calls to XERSAV to XERSVE, and
!           XERCTL to XERCNT.  (RWC)

      SUBROUTINE XERPRN (PREFIX, NPREF, MESSG, NWRAP)
!***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERPRN
!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Print error messages processed by XERMSG.
!***LIBRARY   SLATEC (XERROR)
!***CATEGORY  R3C
!***TYPE      ALL (XERPRN-A)
!***KEYWORDS  ERROR MESSAGES, PRINTING, XERROR
!***AUTHOR  Fong, Kirby, (NMFECC at LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
! This routine sends one or more lines to each of the (up to five)
! LOGICAL      :: units to which error messages are to be sent.  This routine
! is called several times by XERMSG, sometimes with a single line to
! print and sometimes with a (potentially very long) message that may
! wrap around into multiple lines.
!
! PREFIX  Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This argument contains
!         characters to be put at the beginning of each line before
!         the body of the message.  No more than 16 characters of
!         PREFIX will be used.
!
! NPREF   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This argument is the number
!         of characters to use from PREFIX.  If it is negative, the
!         intrinsic function LEN is used to determine its length.  If
!         it is zero, PREFIX is not used.  If it exceeds 16 or if
!         LEN(PREFIX) exceeds 16, only the first 16 characters will be
!         used.  If NPREF is positive and the length of PREFIX is less
!         than NPREF, a copy of PREFIX extended with blanks to length
!         NPREF will be used.
!
! MESSG   Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This is the text of a
!         message to be printed.  If it is a long message, it will be
!         broken into pieces for printing on multiple lines.  Each line
!         will start with the appropriate prefix and be followed by a
!         piece of the message.  NWRAP is the number of characters per
!         piece; that is, after each NWRAP characters, we break and
!         start a new line.  In addition the characters '$$' embedded
!         in MESSG are a sentinel for a new line.  The counting of
!         characters up to NWRAP starts over for each new line.  The
!         value of NWRAP typically used by XERMSG is 72 since many
!         older error messages in the SLATEC Library are laid out to
!         rely on wrap-around every 72 characters.
!
! NWRAP   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This gives the maximum size
!         piece into which to break MESSG for printing on multiple
!         lines.  An embedded '$$' ends a line, and the kount restarts
!         at the following character.  If a line break does not occur
!         on a blank (it would split a word) that word is moved to the
!         next line.  Values of NWRAP less than 16 will be treated as
!         16.  Values of NWRAP greater than 132 will be treated as 132.
!         The actual line length will be NPREF + NWRAP after NPREF has
!         been adjusted to fall between 0 and 16 and NWRAP has been
!         adjusted to fall between 16 and 132.

!           THE HANDLING OF THE NEW LINE SENTINEL TO BEHAVE LIKE THE

!   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
!           STREAMLINE THE CODING AND FIX A BUG THAT CAUSED EXTRA BLANK
!           LINES TO BE PRINTED.
!   890721  REVISED TO ADD A NEW FEATURE.  A NEGATIVE VALUE OF NPREF
!           CAUSES LEN(PREFIX) TO BE USED AS THE LENGTH.
!   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT ERROR IN CALCULATING PREFIX LENGTH.

!     Abstract
!        XGETUA may be called to determine the unit number or numbers

!        These unit numbers may have been set by a call to XSETUN,
!        or a call to XSETUA, or may be a default value.
!
!     Description of Parameters
!      --Output--
!        IUNIT - an array of one to five unit numbers, depending
!                on the value of N.  A value of zero refers to the
!                default unit, as defined by the I1MACH machine
!                constant routine.  Only IUNIT(1),...,IUNIT(N) are
!                defined by XGETUA.  The values of IUNIT(N+1),...,
!                IUNIT(5) are not defined (for N < 5) or altered
!                in any way by XGETUA.
!        N     - the number of units to which copies of the
